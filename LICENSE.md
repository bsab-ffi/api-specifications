# FFI API Specification ‚Äì Read Only License

**Version 1 ‚Äì Effective Date: 2025-04-23**

Bankinfrastruktur i Sverige AB (‚ÄúBSAB‚Äù) is a Swedish company that develops and manages standards and provides support for financial infrastructure, including a set of rules, a message catalogue and technical specifications for sustainable and secure information exchange (‚ÄúFFI‚Äù).

Within the framework of FFI, BSAB owns and manages technical specifications and related materials that support secure and standardized information exchange between participating parties.

All content made publicly available in this repository is collectively referred to as the ‚ÄúMaterials‚Äù, regardless of format, structure, or time of publication. The Materials include the full set of technical, explanatory, and supporting content that BSAB chooses to publish in this repository now or in the future.

The Materials are made publicly accessible in this repository (read only) solely for reference use and transparency and are therefore subject to the restrictions in this license when you (‚ÄúYou‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour‚Äù) access the Materials. For any other use of the Materials than what is explicitly permitted under these license terms, a separate commercial license agreement with BSAB is required. Please contact BSAB using the contact details provided at the end of this license for any queries.

This license governs the access and limited use (read only) of the Materials, solely for internal review purposes. Please note that the license does not apply to entities that have entered a separate agreement with BSAB for commercial use of the Materials.

Any use of the Materials that does not comply with this license is considered unauthorized and constitutes a material breach of the license terms, which may lead to immediate revocation of the license and potential legal action.

## 1. License Grant

Provided that You comply with these license terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable right to access, download and read the Materials solely for your internal review purposes and for non-commercial internal reference use within your organisation, provided that any such further use, in whole or in part, will include:
(a) an unaltered notice identifying BSAB as the copyright holder;
(b) a complete, unmodified copy of these license terms, which shall apply also to such further use.

Ownership of the Materials remains with BSAB, and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. No other rights are granted or implied, and you shall not copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, create derivative works of, or otherwise use the Materials beyond what is expressly permitted by this license. Specifically, you may not, yourself or by facilitating or supporting others:

## 2. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

BSAB provides the Materials as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Materials, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, suitability, quality, reliability, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. The Materials are used at Your own risk.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, BSAB will in no event be liable on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this license or use of the Materials, even if BSAB has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this license is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this license without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

No term or condition of this license will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by BSAB.

This license and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden, excluding its conflict of laws principles providing for the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
